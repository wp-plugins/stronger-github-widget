A plugin to display your Github informations.

== Description ==

A plugin to display your Github informations.
You can display :
* Repositories
* Subscriptions
* Events
* Starred
* Followers
* Following

It uses a server cache to be very light and fast on your WordPress installation.

Don't hesitate to ask me new features or report bugs on [potsky.com](http://www.potsky.com/code/wordpress-plugins/stronger-github-widget/ "Plugin page") !

I don't code these GitHub events because I did't find any informations about the json structure :
* GollumEvent
* MemberEvent
* PublicEvent
* TeamAddEvent

So if you want a better display for these events, send my an API url with these events.
Something like : https://api.github.com/users/MAGICALUSER/events


== Installation ==

**Stronger GitHub Widget** is very easy to install (instructions) :
* Upload the `/stronger-github-widget` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPressÂ®.
